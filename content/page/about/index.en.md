### Hello!

I'm a system administrator and hobbyist programmer from Pozna≈Ñ. I know my way
around GNU/Linux, containers, and web development. My work relies on taking care
of infrastructure, monitoring, and automating everything around software
development.

Besides dealing with computers, I enjoy reading sci-fi, especially the cyberpunk
subgenre. Playing instruments, my main is the bass guitar. Tasting new craft
beers and throwing some cubes with friends in tabletop games. I'm also in the
progress of building a small home-based recording studio and learning how to draw
things.

My prononous are: he/him.
